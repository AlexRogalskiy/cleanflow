# CleanFlow

"A picture is worth a thousand words" is very true in programming.
So, many of us use diagrams (e.g. activity or sequence diagrams) when coding complex business logic.
That not only helps to grasp the logic, but also puts all the stakeholders —
e.g. product managers, analysts, developers, reviewers and maintainers — on the same page.
 
But, maintaining code and diagram in parallel is hard. Not only it takes more effort,
but also the diagrams soon become out of sync. You can never rely on a
diagram — whenever you want to check something, you check the code.
  
CleanFlow solves this issue by letting you move business logic out into elegant diagrams.
When using CleanCode, business logic is expressed and maintained in diagrams.
Code just contains simple methods (hooked into the nodes of the diagram).
So, no more cumbersome control-flows in your code!

Some key benefits of this approach:

* Business logic can be intuitively groomed via diagrams 
* Your code remains clean and straightforward. Bye-bye mind-boggling control flows!
* You no more have to preach [clean-coding](https://medium.com/mindorks/how-to-write-clean-code-lessons-learnt-from-the-clean-code-robert-c-martin-9ffc7aef870c)
to your developers — it becomes natural
* Reviewing code is fast and intuitive
* Understanding existing code it a breeze!
* Code won't deteriorate fast

## Documentation

CleanFlow is not a giant thing — the [getting started guide](https://github.com/naturalprogrammer/cleanflow/wiki/Getting-Started)
covers all its features as of now. And of course, you can refer to the tests for more concrete examples.
